### Quantum_project
1.  Quantum Federated Learning Project
This project is submitted to Qubit by Qubit "Introduction to Quantum Computation" course. I just tried to show how we can use quantum data in federated learning in our near future. All thanks to my Professor (Saifur Rahman Sobuj) Sir for helping me out. As well as this project is not yet completed so if anyone wants to upgrade this so he/she may reach me out😊.
